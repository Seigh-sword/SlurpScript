# 🧃 SlurpScript/**

> 🍌 *A totally fake, emoji-powered programming language.*  
> Created as an AI experiment by Seigh_sword & ChatGPT 🤖

## 🔬 What is this?

**SlurpScript/** is an experimental, meme-filled, emoji-splashed coding language invented purely for fun, creativity, and to showcase how powerful AI can be when building ideas from scratch. 💡

This project explores:
- 💻 How AI can generate and interpret custom syntax
- 🧠 How goofy ideas can turn into working code
- 🍌 How bananas can be programmed to talk (seriously)
- 🧪 How fast experiments can be built without limits

---

## 🚀 Features

- `💬speak "text"` – Logs messages
- `🍓input name` – Asks user input
- `🤔if name == "Bob":` – If-conditions (with emoji flair)
- `💥explode "msg"` – Alert popup (aka surprise boom)
- `🧃drink "msg"` – Ends the code with a slurpy goodbye
- `🐄moo sound="..."` – Cow noises!
- `🍌banana.talk "..."` – Banana speaks to you (why not?)
- `🎲random "A" or "B"` – RNG emoji-style
- `🖼️draw shape="..."` – Draws simple shapes
- `🔊sound play="..."` – (future) Sound triggers

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

🚧 **This language is not real.**  
It’s a fun, chaotic, experimental language designed to test the limits of AI creativity — **not** for real software development.  
But hey, maybe it should be. 🤓
