## 🔬 What is this?

**SlurpScript/** is a totally made-up, emoji-based programming language created as an AI-powered coding experiment. It’s goofy, weird, juicy, and kind of beautiful in its nonsense.

This project explores:
- 💡 How AI can invent languages
- 🤓 Making interpreters for made-up syntax
- 🎨 Blending code, creativity & chaos
- 🧪 What happens when you let AI cook
